Welcome to the Rust workshop 2023! Before starting, make sure you have read the [setup instructions](../README.md).

## About

At WIRIS we want to build an amazing software that lets students understand and manipulate its elementary equations. However, we are having struggles implementing the __String to Object__ conversion.

We already know that the main structures that are required for achieving our objective are:

- The `Token`, that is an [enumeration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html) for representing each relevant particle of an expression
- And the `Node`, that is the smallest unit of the [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) we want to use for representing an expression in memory.  

We also agree that, at least, we need two different methods:

- The `tokenizer`, which is in charge of converting a string into an array of `Tokens`.
- And the `deserializer`, that should take advantage of the `tokenizer` for converting a string into a binary tree.

## Objective

The objective of this workshop is to provide an implementation for both, the `tokenizer` and `deserializer` methods, that makes all the tests pass successfully.

Notice that only elementary operations are contemplated in the solution we expect, any other operator is not allowed, nether are decimal and negative numbers. Just keep it simple!

Also, feel free to add any other structure or method you consider appropriate for the implementation. The only requirement is to keep the code we provide as it is, the rest is up to you.

You fill find the source code [right here](./src/lib.rs).

Good luck, and enjoy! üòÅ

## Testing

In order to run all the tests and see what is up, open a terminal in this workshop's directory and run the following command:

``` bash
cargo test
```
